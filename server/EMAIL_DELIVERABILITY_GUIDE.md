## 📧 Why Emails Go to Spam (And How We Fixed It)

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Missing headers | Added X-Priority, X-Mailer, Reply-To headers |
| No plain text version | Auto-generated from HTML |
| Suspicious content | Professional templates, no spam words |

| No unsubscribe link | Added List-Unsubscribe header |

## 🔧 Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Gmail App Password Setup

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" → "Other (Custom name)"
   - Name it "Savishkar Server"
   - Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)

3. **Update .env File**
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=savishkarjcer@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

```bash
# Start server
npm run dev

# Look for this in logs:
✅ Email Server Connected Successfully!
📧 SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com:587
👤 Sender: savishkarjcer@gmail.com
```

### Step 3: Test Email Sending

```bash
# Run test script
npm run test-email
```

## 📝 Email Best Practices (Implemented)

### 1. Proper Email Structure ✅
- DOCTYPE declaration
- Responsive HTML
- Inline CSS (email clients strip external CSS)
- Alt text for images
- Plain text fallback

### 2. Professional Headers ✅
```javascript
headers: {
  'X-Priority': '1',              // High priority
  'X-MSMail-Priority': 'High',    // Microsoft mail priority
  'Importance': 'high',           // General importance
  'X-Mailer': 'Savishkar Techfest', // Identifies sender
  'Reply-To': process.env.EMAIL_USER // Reply address
}
```

### 3. List-Unsubscribe Header ✅
Helps with deliverability (Gmail likes this):
```javascript
list: {
  unsubscribe: {
    url: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
    comment: 'Unsubscribe'
  }
}
```

### 4. Connection Pooling ✅
```javascript
pool: true,              // Reuse connections
maxConnections: 5,       // Max simultaneous connections
maxMessages: 100,        // Max messages per connection
rateDelta: 1000,         // Time window (1 second)
rateLimit: 5             // Max 5 emails per second
```

### 5. Retry Logic ✅
- 3 retries with exponential backoff
- 2 second initial delay
- 45 second timeout per attempt

## 🚀 Improving Deliverability Further

### Option 1: Warm Up Your Email (Recommended)

**Day 1-3:** Send 10-20 emails/day
**Day 4-7:** Send 50-100 emails/day
**Day 8-14:** Send 200-500 emails/day
**Day 15+:** Normal sending volume

This builds your sender reputation.

### Option 2: Use a Custom Domain

Instead of `savishkarjcer@gmail.com`, use:
- `noreply@savishkar.com`
- `events@savishkar.com`

**Benefits:**
- Professional appearance
- Better deliverability
- Custom SPF/DKIM records

**Setup:**
1. Buy domain (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy)
2. Set up Google Workspace or custom email
3. Configure SPF/DKIM records
4. Update EMAIL_USER in .env

### Option 3: Use a Transactional Email Service

For production, consider:

#### SendGrid (Recommended)
- Free: 100 emails/day
- Paid: $19.95/month for 50k emails
- Excellent deliverability
- Easy setup

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

#### Mailgun
- Free: 5,000 emails/month (first 3 months)
- Paid: $35/month for 50k emails

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=postmaster@your-domain.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PASS=your_mailgun_password
```

#### AWS SES (Cheapest)
- $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- Requires domain verification

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Received

**Check 1: SMTP Connection**
```bash
npm run dev
# Look for: ✅ Email Server Connected Successfully!
```

**Check 2: Email Logs**
```bash
# Check server logs for:
✅ Email sent successfully!
📨 Message ID: <...>
```

**Check 3: Gmail Sent Folder**
- Log into savishkarjcer@gmail.com
- Check "Sent" folder
- If email is there, it was sent successfully

**Check 4: Spam Folder**
- Check recipient's spam folder

### Emails Going to Spam

**Solution 1: Ask Recipients to Whitelist**
1. Add savishkarjcer@gmail.com to contacts
2. Mark first email as "Not Spam"
3. Move to inbox

**Solution 2: Improve Sender Reputation**
- Send consistently (not in bursts)
- Avoid spam trigger words
- Get recipients to open/click emails

**Solution 3: Use Custom Domain**

### Slow Email Sending

**Current Setup:**

**To Speed Up:**

maxConnections: 10,    // More connections
rateLimit: 10          // More emails/second
```
